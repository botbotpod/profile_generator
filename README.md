# profile_generator
This project has been created to generate a *readable* dummy profile.
By *readable*; meaning that it looks like an actual profile of a person without using an actual persons name and address.


## Motivation
When someone is tasked in creating a dummy profile from scratch, they would encounter the following scenario's:
 1. Create an fake profile like below:
 ```
 Name: Batman
 Address: 123 Batcave , Gotham City
 ```
 
 2. Create a profile with a standard name and search actual addresses on the internet to use with the profile,
 realising later on that it takes more time and effort than expected to do it manually.
 
This project aims to save time in generating dummy data for testing by automating this process.

This profile generator will generate the following information **into a CSV file**:
```
First Name:
Last Name:
Address:
Phone:
Email:
```

It uses over a thousand common names and hundreds of cities of the respectful country, which are randomly selected and generated
to look like an actual profile.

## How to use it
Download the folders and go to the respective python file inside the folder, follow the instructions inside the file 
and then run the file to have it generate the data.

It is recommended to download the whole folder to generate the data offline.
